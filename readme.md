# Polynomial Regression for Predictive Sports Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we aim to build a polynomial regression model for predicting the points scored by a sports team.

---

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about the points scored by sports teams based on various attributes.

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Outlier removal
    - Imputing null values
    - One-hot encoding

2. **Model Building:**
    - Linear regression model building
    - Polynomial regression model building

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluating the model on test data
    - Discussion of various regression metrics like R-squared, AIC, AICC, F-statistics

## Concepts Explored

1. Understanding Distribution plots, Box plots, Violin plots.
2. Outliers in data.
  - Pandas imputer.
  - Iterative imputer.
  - KNN imputer.
  - LGBM imputer.
3. Univariate analysis.
4. Chatterjee correlation.
5. Implementation of ANOVA.
6. AIC (Akaike Information Criterion).
7. Likelihood in statistical modeling.
