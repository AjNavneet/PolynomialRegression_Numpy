# Polynomial Regression for Predictive Sports Analysis

## Overview

In this project, we aim to build a polynomial regression model for predicting the points scored by a sports team.

---

## Data Description

The dataset contains information about the points scored by sports teams based on various attributes.

---

## Tech Stack

- Language: `Python`
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - Outlier removal
    - Imputing null values
    - One-hot encoding

2. **Model Building:**
    - Linear regression model building
    - Polynomial regression model building

3. **Model Evaluation:**
    - Evaluating the model on test data
    - Discussion of various regression metrics like R-squared, AIC, AICC, F-statistics

2. Outliers in data.
3. Pandas imputer.
4. Iterative imputer.
5. KNN imputer.
6. LGBM imputer.
7. Univariate analysis.
8. Chatterjee correlation.
